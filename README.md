## Overview

It is an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches daily weather data from the Open-Meteo API, processes it, and stores the results in a PostgreSQL database. The project demonstrates workflow orchestration with Apache Airflow, containerization with Docker, and data management using PostgreSQL. DBeaver is used for easy database exploration, and deploying and managing workflows is done with Astronomer (Astro).

## Technologies Used

Apache Airflow: Orchestrates ETL workflows. <br>
Python: Core language for data processing.<br>
Open-Meteo API: Free weather data provider.<br>
PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing processed weather data.<br>
DBeaver: GUI tool to explore and query the PostgreSQL database.<br>
Docker: Containerizes the application for consistent development and deployment environments.<br>
Astronomer (Astro): Cloud-based orchestration platform for deploying Airflow pipelines.<br>
